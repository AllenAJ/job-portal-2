Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney Colege in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Loem Isum passage, and going through the cites of the word in cassical literature, discvered the undbtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Borum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Reance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
